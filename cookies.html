                <p>This Cookie Policy explains how Ryokome uses cookies and similar tracking technologies on our website.</p>
                
                <h2>What Are Cookies?</h2>
                <p>Cookies are small text files that are placed on your device when you visit a website. They help websites remember information about your visit, such as your preferences and actions. Cookies can be set by the website you're visiting (first-party cookies) or by third parties whose services are used on that website (third-party cookies).</p>
                
                <h2>How We Use Cookies</h2>
                <p>We use cookies to enhance your experience on our website, understand how visitors use our site, and support our business operations. The cookies we use fall into several categories:</p>
                
                <h3>Essential Cookies</h3>
                <p>These cookies are necessary for the website to function properly. They enable basic features like page navigation and access to secure areas of the website. The website cannot function properly without these cookies.</p>
                
                <h3>Analytics Cookies</h3>
                <p>These cookies help us understand how visitors interact with our website by collecting and reporting information anonymously. This includes data about which pages are visited most often, how long visitors stay on pages, and any error messages encountered. This information helps us improve how our website works.</p>
                
                <h3>Functionality Cookies</h3>
                <p>These cookies allow the website to remember choices you make, such as your preferred language or region, to provide enhanced and more personalized features. They may also be used to remember changes you've made to text size, fonts, and other customizable parts of the website.</p>
                
                <h3>Advertising and Affiliate Cookies</h3>
                <p>We work with affiliate partners and advertising networks that may place cookies on your device. These cookies help track conversions and attribute bookings to our referrals. They may also be used to deliver relevant advertisements and limit the number of times you see an ad.</p>
                
                <h2>Third-Party Cookies</h2>
                <p>Our website includes widgets and services from third-party providers, including travel search tools from Aviasales and Travelpayouts. These third parties may set their own cookies on your device for purposes such as:</p>

                </ul>
                
                <p>We do not control these third-party cookies. We recommend reviewing the privacy policies of our third-party partners to understand their cookie practices.</p>
                
                <h2>Managing Cookies</h2>
