                <h1>Affiliate Disclosure</h1>
                <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: January 2, 2025</p>
                
                <p>This disclosure explains how Ryokome earns revenue and our commitment to maintaining transparency and editorial independence.</p>
                
                <h2>How We Earn Revenue</h2>
                <p>Ryokome operates as a travel comparison platform that earns revenue through affiliate partnerships. When you use our search tools and widgets to find travel services, and subsequently make a booking with one of our partner providers, we may earn a commission from that booking.</p>
                
                <h2>Affiliate Partnerships</h2>
                <p>We partner with established travel service aggregators and providers, including but not limited to Aviasales and Travelpayouts. These partnerships allow us to offer comprehensive search tools that compare prices from hundreds of airlines, car rental companies, and transfer services.</p>
                
                <p>When you click on search results or make bookings through widgets on our site, we may receive a commission from the provider. This commission comes from the provider's marketing budget and does not increase the price you pay. The prices you see through our platform are the same as if you booked directly with the provider.</p>
                
                <h2>No Extra Cost to You</h2>
                <p>It's important to understand that using Ryokome does not cost you anything extra. The commissions we earn are paid by travel service providers as a marketing expense for referring customers. You pay the same price whether you book through our platform or directly with the provider.</p>
                
                <h2>Editorial Independence</h2>
                <p>Our affiliate partnerships do not influence how we present travel options to you. We are committed to maintaining editorial independence and providing unbiased comparison tools. Our search widgets display results based on factors like price, duration, and relevance to your search query, not on commission rates.</p>
                
                <h2>Transparency in Service</h2>
                <p>We believe in transparency about how our business works. As a comparison platform, we connect travelers with service providers but do not sell flights, cars, or transfers directly. Our role is to make it easier for you to find and compare options from multiple providers in one place.</p>
                
                <h2>Third-Party Relationships</h2>
                <p>When you book through providers accessed via our website, you enter into a direct relationship with that provider. Ryokome is not responsible for the booking, the service quality, pricing changes, cancellations, or any issues that arise. These matters are handled directly between you and the service provider.</p>
                
                <h2>Our Commitment to Users</h2>
                <p>Despite earning commissions, our primary goal is to help you find the best travel deals. We invest our revenue into improving our platform, maintaining our website, and providing better comparison tools. Your trust is important to us, and we're committed to being transparent about how we operate.</p>
                
                <h2>Questions</h2>
                <p>If you have questions about our affiliate relationships or how we earn revenue, please feel free to contact us through the information provided on our About page. We're happy to provide additional clarity about our business model and partnerships.</p>
