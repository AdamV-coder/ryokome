                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>Ryokome participates in affiliate marketing programs, including the TravelPayouts network. This means we may earn commissions when you book travel through links on our site, at no additional cost to you. These commissions help fund our research and content creation.</p>
                <p><strong>Our editorial content is never influenced by these commissions.</strong> We maintain strict separation between our revenue streams and our editorial decisions.</p>

                <div class="explanation-card">
                    <h3>The Basic Model</h3>
                    <p>When you click on certain links on our site and make a purchase, the merchant pays us a small commission. This comes out of their marketing budget, not from your pocket.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="explanation-card">
                    <h3>Cost to You</h3>
                    <p>There is <strong>never</strong> an additional charge to you for using our links. Prices are identical whether you use our links or go directly to the merchant.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="explanation-card">
                    <h3>Our Primary Network</h3>
