        <h1>Affiliate Disclosure</h1>
        <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> January 2024</p>

        <h2>Our Commitment to Transparency</h2>
        <p>At Ryokome, transparency and honesty are core values. We want you to understand exactly how our business works and how we earn money while providing free travel comparison services. This Affiliate Disclosure explains our business relationships and how they may influence the content you see on our website.</p>

        <h2>How Ryokome Earns Revenue</h2>
        <p>Ryokome operates as an affiliate marketing website in the travel industry. We partner with airlines, hotels, car rental companies, booking platforms, and other travel service providers. When you use our search tools, compare options, and click through to book travel services with one of our partners, we may earn a commission from that partner if you complete a purchase.</p>

        <p>Importantly, using Ryokome does not cost you anything extra. The prices you see on our website and pay when booking are the same as if you went directly to the airline or booking site. Our commission is paid by the travel provider, not by you.</p>

        <h2>Affiliate Partnerships</h2>
        <p>We maintain affiliate relationships with numerous travel companies and platforms, including but not limited to:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Flight Booking Platforms:</strong> Online travel agencies and flight aggregators that sell airline tickets</li>
          <li><strong>Airlines:</strong> Major carriers and budget airlines worldwide</li>
          <li><strong>Hotel Booking Sites:</strong> Platforms that offer hotel reservations and accommodation bookings</li>
          <li><strong>Car Rental Companies:</strong> Major car rental brands and local providers</li>
          <li><strong>Transfer Services:</strong> Airport shuttle and ground transportation providers</li>
          <li><strong>Travel Insurance Providers:</strong> Companies offering travel insurance products</li>
          <li><strong>Travel Activity Platforms:</strong> Sites selling tours, experiences, and activities</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Commission rates vary by partner and may be based on the booking value, a fixed amount per transaction, or other arrangements. These partnerships allow us to keep our comparison service completely free for users while covering our operating costs and continuing to improve our platform.</p>

        <h2>How We Select and Rank Partners</h2>
        <p>Our primary goal is to help you find the best travel deals, not to maximize our commission revenue. We prioritize your interests over our financial gain when presenting search results and recommendations.</p>

        <h3>Search Results Ranking</h3>
        <p>When you search for flights, hotels, or car rentals on Ryokome, our default search results are ranked primarily by:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Price:</strong> Lowest to highest price is typically the default sorting</li>
          <li><strong>Value:</strong> Overall value considering price, convenience, and quality</li>
          <li><strong>Relevance:</strong> How well options match your search criteria</li>
          <li><strong>User Preferences:</strong> Filters and sorting options you select</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Commission rates do not determine the order of search results. We show you options from partners who pay us commissions alongside options from partners who don't, all ranked according to the criteria above. Our comparison tools include providers regardless of whether they offer affiliate commissions.</p>

        <h3>Featured Deals and Recommendations</h3>
        <p>Occasionally, we may highlight specific deals, offers, or recommendations on our website. These features may be influenced by our partnerships, promotional agreements, or commission rates. When this occurs, we aim to clearly identify sponsored or featured content where appropriate. However, we only feature deals that we genuinely believe offer good value to our users.</p>

        <h2>Editorial Independence</h2>
        <p>Our affiliate relationships do not compromise our editorial independence or the integrity of our comparison services. We maintain the following standards:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>We provide honest, accurate information about travel services and options</li>
          <li>We do not hide better deals or options to push higher-commission alternatives</li>
          <li>We base recommendations on price, quality, convenience, and value – not commission rates</li>
          <li>We disclose our affiliate relationships openly and transparently</li>
          <li>We maintain objective comparison criteria across all partners</li>
          <li>We continuously evaluate partners based on user experience, not just commission potential</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What Happens When You Click Our Links</h2>
        <p>When you click on a flight, hotel, car rental, or other travel option in our search results, you'll be directed to the partner's website where you can complete your booking. This link may contain tracking parameters that identify you as a Ryokome referral, allowing the partner to credit us with the commission if you make a purchase.</p>

        <p>The partner website will have its own terms, conditions, privacy policy, and booking policies. We are not responsible for the partner's practices, policies, or the services they provide. Your transaction is directly with the travel provider or booking platform, not with Ryokome.</p>

        <h2>No Additional Cost to You</h2>
        <p>We want to emphasize again: using Ryokome and booking through our affiliate links does not increase the price you pay. The commission we earn is already factored into the prices set by travel providers. Whether you find that flight or hotel through Ryokome, a search engine, or by going directly to the airline's website, you'll pay the same price.</p>

        <p>In many cases, booking through our links may actually save you money because our comparison tools help you find deals you might not have discovered otherwise.</p>

        <h2>Non-Affiliate Content</h2>
        <p>Not all content on Ryokome is created for affiliate marketing purposes. We provide informational content, travel tips, destination guides, and other resources designed to help you plan better trips. This educational content serves our users' interests and improves the overall value of our platform, regardless of whether it directly generates affiliate revenue.</p>

        <h2>Third-Party Advertisements</h2>
        <p>In addition to affiliate links, Ryokome may display advertising from third-party ad networks. These advertisements are typically based on your browsing behavior and interests and may be related to travel or other topics. Ad partners may use cookies and similar technologies to deliver relevant ads. See our <a href="/cookie-policy.html">Cookie Policy</a> for more information.</p>

        <h2>Changes to Our Partnerships</h2>
        <p>Our affiliate partnerships change over time as we add new partners, remove underperforming ones, or update commission agreements. We may also test different partners and commission structures to optimize the value we provide to users while maintaining sustainable revenue. These changes do not affect our commitment to transparent, user-focused comparison services.</p>

        <h2>Your Trust Matters</h2>
        <p>We recognize that your trust is our most valuable asset. Ryokome exists because millions of travelers trust us to provide honest, comprehensive travel comparisons. We would never compromise that trust for short-term financial gain. Our long-term success depends on continuing to earn your trust by delivering genuine value and maintaining the highest standards of integrity.</p>

        <h2>Questions and Feedback</h2>
        <p>We welcome your questions about our affiliate relationships and business model. If something is unclear or you have concerns about how we present information, we want to hear from you. Your feedback helps us improve and maintain the transparency that defines Ryokome.</p>

        <h2>Legal Compliance</h2>
        <p>This disclosure complies with the Federal Trade Commission's guidelines on affiliate marketing disclosures and similar regulations in other jurisdictions. We are committed to following all applicable laws and regulations governing affiliate marketing and online advertising.</p>
