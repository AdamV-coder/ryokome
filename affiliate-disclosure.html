            <h2>Commission Disclosure</h2>
            <p>Ryokome participates in various affiliate marketing programs, which means we may earn commissions on purchases made through our links to retailer sites. Our travel comparison service is completely free to use, and the commissions we earn help support our operations and continued development.</p>
            
            <h2>How Our Service Works</h2>
            <p>When you search for travel options on Ryokome, we display results from various travel providers and booking platforms. If you click on a deal and make a purchase, we may receive a commission from that booking at no additional cost to you.</p>
            
            <h2>Price Impact</h2>
            <p>Our affiliate partnerships do not affect the prices you pay. The prices displayed on our platform are the same as you would find by going directly to the travel provider's website. In fact, we often help users find lower prices than they would find elsewhere.</p>
            
            <h2>Transparency Commitment</h2>
            <p>We are committed to transparency and honesty in all our partnerships. While we earn commissions, our primary goal is to help travelers find the best possible deals. Our editorial content, recommendations, and search results are not influenced by potential commissions.</p>
            
            <h2>Partnerships</h2>
            <p>We work with a variety of travel partners including airlines, hotel chains, car rental companies, and online travel agencies (OTAs). Some of our partners include (but are not limited to):</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Major airline carriers</li>
                <li>Hotel booking platforms</li>
                <li>Car rental companies</li>
                <li>Travel insurance providers</li>
                <li>Airport transfer services</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>User Experience</h2>
            <p>Our affiliate relationships are designed to be seamless for users. When you click on a deal and are redirected to a booking site, the experience is identical to going directly to that site. The only difference is that we may earn a commission if you complete a purchase.</p>
            
            <h2>Questions?</h2>
            <p>If you have any questions about our affiliate relationships or how we make money, please don't hesitate to <a href="about.html">contact us</a>.</p>
            
            <p>Thank you for using Ryokome to plan your travels!</p>
