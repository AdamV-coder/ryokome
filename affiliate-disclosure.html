      <h1>Affiliate Disclosure</h1>
      <p><em>Last Updated: January 14, 2026</em></p>

      <section class="content-section">
        <h2>Purpose of This Disclosure</h2>
        <p>Ryokome is committed to transparency about how we generate revenue and maintain our website. This disclosure explains our affiliate relationships, how we earn money, and how these relationships may influence the content and tools on our site.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="content-section">
        <h2>Affiliate Relationships</h2>
        <p>Ryokome participates in affiliate marketing programs with various travel service providers, including airlines, booking platforms, car rental companies, and transfer services. When you use our search tools or click on certain links and complete a booking, we may earn a commission from our partners.</p>

        <p>These commissions are paid by the travel companies, not by you as the user. The price you pay when booking through our links is the same price you would pay if you went directly to the provider's website. Our affiliate relationships do not increase your cost.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="content-section">
        <h2>How We Earn Revenue</h2>

        <h3>Affiliate Commissions</h3>
        <p>When you click on a link to a partner website from Ryokome and complete a purchase or booking, we may receive a commission. This is our primary source of revenue and allows us to provide free search tools and travel information to users.</p>

        <h3>Search Widgets and Tools</h3>
        <p>The flight search, car rental, and other comparison widgets on our website are provided by our affiliate partners. When you use these tools and proceed to book through the results, our partners may pay us a commission if a booking is completed.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="content-section">
        <h2>Editorial Independence</h2>
        <p>While we earn revenue through affiliate relationships, we maintain editorial independence in how we present information and recommendations. We do not:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Prioritize partners based on commission rates</li>
          <li>Hide or exclude better options because they pay lower commissions</li>
          <li>Make false claims or exaggerate benefits to increase bookings</li>
          <li>Manipulate search results to favor higher-paying partners</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Our search tools display results based on factors like price, relevance, and user preferences, not on what generates the highest commission for Ryokome.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="content-section">
        <h2>Transparency in Links and Content</h2>
        <p>Links throughout our website that may generate affiliate revenue include:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Flight search and booking widgets</li>
          <li>Car rental comparison tools</li>
          <li>Transfer and transportation service links</li>
          <li>Links to booking platforms and travel service providers</li>
          <li>Hotel and accommodation search tools where applicable</li>
        </ul>

        <p>In general, assume that any link directing you to an external booking platform, airline, car rental company, or travel service provider may be an affiliate link through which we earn a commission.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="content-section">
        <h2>No Guarantee of Best Price</h2>
        <p>While we make efforts to display competitive options through our comparison tools, we cannot guarantee that the results shown are always the absolute lowest prices available. Travel pricing changes frequently, and different booking platforms may have exclusive deals or pricing that varies based on numerous factors.</p>

        <p>We encourage travelers to compare multiple sources and verify pricing directly with providers when making important travel decisions.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="content-section">
        <h2>Third-Party Responsibility</h2>
        <p>When you click through from Ryokome to a partner website and complete a booking, the transaction is between you and that company. We are not responsible for:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>The accuracy of pricing or availability on partner sites</li>
          <li>The quality of services provided by airlines, hotels, rental companies, or transfer services</li>
          <li>Customer service issues related to bookings made through partner sites</li>
          <li>Changes to itineraries, cancellations, or refunds processed by third parties</li>
          <li>The terms and conditions of bookings made with our partners</li>
        </ul>

        <p>For support with bookings, contact the company with whom you made the reservation directly. Partner companies have their own terms of service, cancellation policies, and customer support systems.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="content-section">
        <h2>Updates to This Disclosure</h2>
        <p>We may update this affiliate disclosure from time to time to reflect changes in our partnerships, revenue sources, or business practices. Material changes will be noted by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this page.</p>

        <p>We encourage you to review this disclosure periodically to stay informed about how we generate revenue and our commitment to transparency.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="content-section">
        <h2>Questions About Our Affiliate Relationships</h2>
        <p>If you have questions about our affiliate partnerships, how we earn revenue, or any aspect of this disclosure, please contact us. We are committed to operating transparently and addressing user concerns about our business practices.</p>

      <section class="content-section">
        <h2>Compliance</h2>
        <p>Ryokome complies with applicable regulations regarding affiliate marketing disclosure, including guidelines from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in the United States and similar regulatory bodies in other jurisdictions. We believe in honest, transparent communication with our users about how we operate and earn revenue.</p>
