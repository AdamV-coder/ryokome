                    <h2>Our Commitment to Transparency</h2>
                    <p>Ryokome believes in being completely transparent about how we operate and earn revenue. This disclosure explains our affiliate relationships and how they may affect the content and services you see on our website.</p>
                </section>

                <section class="content-section">
                    <h2>Affiliate Relationships</h2>
                    <p>Ryokome participates in affiliate marketing programs, which means we earn commissions when visitors use our search tools and booking widgets to make purchases. Specifically:</p>
                    
                    <h3>Travel Booking Affiliates</h3>
                    <p>We partner with travel booking platforms including TravelPayouts and Aviasales. When you search for flights, car rentals, or airport transfers using the widgets on our site and complete a booking, we may receive a commission from the booking platform.</p>
                    
                    <p>These commissions come from the booking platform, not from you. The prices you see and pay are the same whether you book through our widgets or go directly to the booking site. Our commission is the platform's way of paying us for referring customers to their service.</p>
                    
                    <h3>How Commissions Work</h3>
                    <p>When you click on a booking widget or search tool on Ryokome and complete a transaction:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The booking platform tracks that you came from our website</li>
                        <li>If you complete a booking, we receive a small percentage of the transaction value</li>
                        <li>Commission rates vary by platform, service type, and specific offers</li>
                        <li>You are not charged any additional fees for using our referral links</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                <section class="content-section">
                    <h2>Editorial Independence</h2>
                    <p>Our affiliate relationships do not influence our content or recommendations. Here's what that means in practice:</p>
                    
                    <h3>Honest Recommendations</h3>
                    <p>We provide information and advice based on what we genuinely believe will help you make better travel decisions. We don't promote certain options simply because they pay higher commissions. If a particular choice doesn't make sense for your situation, we'll tell you—even if it means you don't book through us.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Content First, Revenue Second</h3>
                    <p>Our primary goal is creating helpful travel content that serves your needs. Revenue through affiliate commissions is important for sustaining our operations, but it doesn't drive our content decisions. We write about topics because they're useful to travelers, not because they might generate more bookings.</p>
                    
                    <h3>No Hidden Biases</h3>
                    <p>We don't accept payment from airlines, car rental companies, or other travel services to feature them more prominently or give them favorable treatment. The booking widgets and search tools on our site show results based on the platform's own algorithms and your search criteria, not based on promotional arrangements.</p>

                    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
                    <p>The booking widgets and search tools on Ryokome are provided by our affiliate partners. When you use these tools:</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li>You interact directly with the third-party booking platform</li>
                        <li>The platform's terms of service and privacy policy apply to your transaction</li>
                        <li>Ryokome is not responsible for the booking process, customer service, or fulfillment of your reservation</li>
                        <li>Any questions about bookings should be directed to the booking platform</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>We choose affiliate partners we believe offer reliable service and fair pricing, but we cannot guarantee their performance or take responsibility for issues that arise with third-party services.</p>

                    <h2>Other Potential Revenue Sources</h2>
                    <p>Currently, affiliate commissions from travel bookings are our primary revenue source. In the future, we may explore other monetization methods such as:</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li>Display advertising</li>
                        <li>Sponsored content (clearly labeled as such)</li>
                        <li>Premium services or tools</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>Any new revenue sources will be disclosed transparently, and we will maintain our commitment to editorial independence regardless of business model changes.</p>

                <section class="content-section">
                    <h2>FTC Compliance</h2>
                    <p>This disclosure complies with the Federal Trade Commission's guidelines on affiliate marketing and endorsements. We believe consumers deserve to know about financial relationships that might influence content they consume online.</p>
                    
                    <p>Beyond regulatory compliance, we consider transparency a fundamental value. You should understand how websites you use make money and what incentives might influence what you see.</p>

                    <h2>Your Choice</h2>
                    <p>You are never obligated to use our affiliate links or booking widgets. You can:</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li>Use our content and resources for information, then book directly with travel providers</li>
                        <li>Compare our widgets' results with other booking sites</li>
                        <li>Choose whatever booking method works best for you</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>Our goal is providing valuable travel information and convenient booking tools. If you find our content helpful and choose to book through our site, we appreciate your support. If you prefer to book elsewhere, we're still glad we could help with your travel planning.</p>
