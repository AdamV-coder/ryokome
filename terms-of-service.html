        <p>Ryokome is a travel comparison website that provides search tools and information to help users compare flights, car rentals, airport transfers, and related travel services. We aggregate information from third-party partners and provide links to external booking platforms.</p>

        <p>Ryokome is not a travel agency, airline, hotel operator, car rental company, or transfer service provider. We do not sell travel services directly. All bookings are made through third-party partners, and transactions are between you and those third parties.</p>
