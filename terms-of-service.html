        <p>Our Services display information from third-party travel providers including airlines, hotels, car rental companies, and booking platforms. When you click through to book travel services, you are interacting directly with these third parties, not with Ryokome.</p>

        <p>We are not responsible for the accuracy, completeness, or availability of third-party information, prices, or services. Bookings are subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable third-party provider. We do not guarantee prices, availability, or the quality of services offered by third parties.</p>

        <h2>Accuracy of Information</h2>
        <p>We strive to provide accurate and up-to-date information, but we cannot guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of all content on our Services. Travel prices and availability change frequently and may differ from what is displayed on our Services. Always verify current prices and terms with the booking provider before completing a purchase.</p>

        <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>The content, features, and functionality of our Services, including text, graphics, logos, images, and software, are owned by Ryokome and protected by copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property laws.

        <h2>User-Generated Content</h2>
        <p>If you submit reviews, comments, or other content to our Services, you grant Ryokome a non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, worldwide license to use, reproduce, modify, and display such content. You represent that you have the right to grant this license and that your content does not violate any third-party rights or applicable laws.</p>

        <h2>Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
        <p>OUR SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, INCLUDING IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.</p>

        <p>We do not warrant that our Services will be uninterrupted, error-free, or secure, or that defects will be corrected. We make no warranties about the accuracy, reliability, or completeness of information provided through our Services.</p>

        <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, RYOKOME SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, USE, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES.</p>

        <p>IN NO EVENT SHALL OUR TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO OUR SERVICES EXCEED ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100) OR THE AMOUNT YOU PAID US IN THE PAST TWELVE MONTHS, WHICHEVER IS GREATER.</p>

        <h2>Indemnification</h2>
        <p>You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Ryokome and its officers, directors, employees, and agents from any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, arising out of or related to your use of our Services, your violation of these Terms, or your violation of any rights of another party.</p>

        <h2>Modifications to Services</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue any aspect of our Services at any time without notice. We will not be liable to you or any third party for any modification, suspension, or discontinuation of our Services.</p>

        <h2>Changes to Terms</h2>
        <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. If we make material changes, we will notify you by posting the updated Terms on this page with a new "Last Updated" date. Your continued use of our Services after changes become effective constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>

        <h2>Termination</h2>
        <p>We may terminate or suspend your access to our Services immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason, including if you breach these Terms. Upon termination, your right to use our Services will immediately cease.</p>

        <h2>Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</h2>
        <p>These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which Ryokome operates, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. Any disputes arising from these Terms or your use of our Services shall be resolved through binding arbitration in accordance with the rules of the applicable arbitration association.</p>

        <h2>Severability</h2>
        <p>If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.</p>

        <h2>Entire Agreement</h2>
