                <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
                <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: January 2, 2025</p>
                
                <p>These Terms of Service govern your use of the Ryokome website. By accessing or using our website, you agree to be bound by these terms.</p>
                
                <h2>Service Description</h2>
                <p>Ryokome is a travel comparison platform that helps users find and compare travel services including flights, car rentals, and airport transfers. We provide search tools and widgets that connect you with third-party travel service providers.</p>
                
                <h2>Comparison Service Only</h2>
                <p>Ryokome is a comparison and referral service. We do not sell flights, cars, or transfers directly. When you use our search tools, you are interacting with widgets provided by third-party partners. Any bookings you make are subject to the terms and conditions of those third-party providers.</p>
                
                <h2>No Guarantees</h2>
                <p>While we strive to provide accurate and up-to-date information, we do not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or reliability of any content or search results displayed on our website. Prices, availability, and terms are determined by third-party providers and may change without notice.</p>
                
                <h2>Third-Party Relationships</h2>
                <p>When you book through providers accessed via our website, you enter into a direct contractual relationship with that provider. Ryokome is not a party to that transaction and is not responsible for the services provided, pricing, cancellations, refunds, or any disputes that may arise.</p>
                
                <h2>User Conduct</h2>
                <p>You agree to use our website only for lawful purposes. You may not:</p>

                <p>As disclosed in our Affiliate Disclosure, we earn commissions from bookings made through our partner links. This does not affect the prices you pay. We maintain editorial independence in how we present travel options.</p>
                
                <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
                <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, Ryokome and its affiliates shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising from your use of the website or any bookings made through third-party providers.</p>
