      <h1>About Ryokome</h1>

      <section class="content-section">
        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>Ryokome was created to make travel planning simpler and more transparent. We recognize that finding the best travel options requires visiting multiple websites, comparing countless prices, and navigating confusing booking processes. Our platform brings flight search, car rentals, and airport transfers into one convenient location, saving travelers time and effort.</p>

        <p>We believe travelers deserve honest, straightforward information without hidden fees or misleading marketing. Our approach is to provide useful comparison tools and clear, practical travel information that helps you make informed decisions.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="content-section">
        <h2>What We Do</h2>
        <p>Ryokome is a travel comparison website that connects travelers with established booking platforms and service providers. We do not operate airlines, rental car companies, or transfer services. Instead, we aggregate options from multiple sources so you can compare prices and features in one place.</p>

        <h3>Our Services Include:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Flight Search:</strong> Compare airfares from hundreds of airlines and booking sites to find competitive prices for your route and dates.</li>
          <li><strong>Car Rental Comparison:</strong> Search rental car options from major providers at airports and cities worldwide.</li>
          <li><strong>Airport Transfer Information:</strong> Learn about pre-arranged transportation options and reliable transfer services.</li>
          <li><strong>Travel Resources:</strong> Access practical travel information including our comprehensive travel checklist and destination guidance.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="content-section">
        <h2>How We Work</h2>
        <p>When you use our search tools, you are accessing comparison technology provided by our travel partners. These tools display options from airlines, booking platforms, car rental companies, and transfer services. When you click through to book, you are redirected to the partner's website where the transaction is completed.</p>

        <p>We earn a commission from our partners when users complete bookings through our links. This affiliate model is standard in the travel industry and allows us to provide free search tools and information to travelers. Importantly, the commission we earn does not increase your price. The rate you see on our site is the same rate you would pay if you went directly to the booking site.</p>

        <p>We are transparent about these relationships. For full details about how we earn revenue and our partnerships, please read our <a href="/affiliate-disclosure.html">Affiliate Disclosure</a>.</p>

        <h2>Our Values</h2>

        <h3>Transparency</h3>
        <p>We clearly disclose our affiliate relationships and how we generate revenue. We do not hide fees, manipulate prices, or use deceptive marketing tactics.</p>

        <h3>Independence</h3>
        <p>We do not prioritize partners based on commission rates. Our search tools display results based on relevance, price, and user preferences, not on what pays us the most.</p>

        <h3>User Focus</h3>
        <p>Our primary goal is to help travelers make good decisions. We provide honest information, practical guidance, and tools that genuinely save time and effort in the travel planning process.</p>

        <h3>Quality Information</h3>
        <p>We invest effort in creating useful, accurate content. Our travel checklist, destination information, and guidance are researched and written to be genuinely helpful, not just to fill web pages with keywords.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="content-section">
        <h2>Privacy and Data Protection</h2>
        <p>We take your privacy seriously. We do not sell personal information, and we limit data collection to what is necessary for the website to function and improve. When you use our search tools, you are interacting with technology provided by our partners, who have their own privacy policies.</p>

        <p>For complete information about how we handle data, please read our <a href="/privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

      <section class="content-section">
        <h2>Contact Information</h2>
        <p>If you have questions about Ryokome, our services, or how we operate, we welcome your inquiry. Please note that we cannot assist with bookings made through partner sites, as those transactions are handled directly by the booking platforms. For support with existing reservations, contact the company where you completed your booking.</p>

        <p>For general inquiries about Ryokome, you can reach us through the contact information available on our partner platforms or through standard web contact methods.</p>

      <section class="content-section">
        <h2>Commitment to Improvement</h2>
        <p>Travel technology and user needs evolve constantly. We are committed to improving our tools, expanding our resources, and maintaining accurate, helpful information for travelers. Your feedback helps us identify areas for improvement and new features that would be valuable.</p>

        <p>Thank you for choosing Ryokome to assist with your travel planning. We hope our platform saves you time and helps you find excellent travel options for your next journey.</p>
