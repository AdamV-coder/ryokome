                <h1>Our Story & Mission</h1>
                
                <p>Ryokome (旅行め, meaning "travel focus" in Japanese) was born from a simple observation: Travel planning had become overwhelming. With hundreds of booking sites, conflicting information, and hidden fees, travelers were spending more time researching than enjoying their trips.</p>
                
                <h2>Our Journey Began with a Problem</h2>
                
                <p>In 2018, after planning a complex multi-country trip across Asia, I spent over 40 hours comparing flights, accommodations, transportation, and insurance. Despite this effort, I still made expensive mistakes and missed better deals that were hidden across different platforms.</p>
                
                <p>That experience led to a question: <strong>Why isn't there a single place where travelers can compare all aspects of their trip and get genuinely helpful advice?</strong></p>
                
                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <h3>Our Core Belief</h3>
                    <p>Travel should be about exploration and experiences, not about spending hours comparing prices or worrying about getting the best deal. Technology should simplify travel planning, not complicate it.</p>
                </div>
                
                <h2>What Makes Ryokome Different</h2>
                
                <h3>1. Comparison Without Compromise</h3>
                <p>Unlike many travel sites that push specific partners or hide better deals, we show you <strong>all</strong> available options. Our comparison tools search hundreds of providers simultaneously, giving you the complete picture.</p>
                
                <h3>2. Experience-Based Advice</h3>
                <p>Every guide, checklist, and article on Ryokome comes from real travel experience. Our team has collectively visited over 75 countries and learned from both wonderful experiences and costly mistakes.</p>
                
                <h3>3. No Hidden Agendas</h3>
                <p>We're transparent about being an affiliate site, but we never let commissions influence our recommendations. If we suggest something, it's because we genuinely believe it's the best option for travelers.</p>
                
                <h2>Our Values</h2>

                <h3>2. Save Money</h3>

                <h2>How We Work with Partners</h2>
                
                <p>Ryokome partners with trusted travel providers through affiliate networks like Travelpayouts. Here's how it works:</p>
                
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Comparison:</strong> We show you prices from multiple providers</li>
                    <li><strong>Selection:</strong> You choose the option that works best for you</li>
                    <li><strong>Booking:</strong> You book directly with the provider</li>
                    <li><strong>Support:</strong> The provider handles your booking and support</li>
                    <li><strong>Commission:</strong> If you book through our links, we may receive a small commission at no extra cost to you</li>
                </ol>
                
                <p><strong>Important:</strong> We never let affiliate relationships influence which providers we show or recommend. Our comparison tools show all available options, and our guides provide unbiased advice.</p>
