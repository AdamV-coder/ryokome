        <!-- Our Story -->
        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>Ryokome was founded in 2023 by a group of passionate travelers who noticed a gap in the online travel space. While there were plenty of booking sites and travel blogs, there was a lack of truly unbiased, practical advice focused on helping travelers make informed decisions.</p>
            
            <p>The name "Ryokome" combines the Japanese words "ryokō" (旅行) meaning "travel" and "kome" (米) meaning "rice" - a staple food. Just as rice sustains people, we aim to provide foundational, nourishing travel knowledge that sustains your journeys.</p>
            
            <p>What started as a side project sharing travel tips among friends has grown into a comprehensive resource used by thousands of travelers worldwide. We're not backed by venture capital or owned by a large travel corporation - we remain independent to ensure our advice stays genuine.</p>
