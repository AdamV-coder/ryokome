                    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
                    <p>Ryokome exists to make travel planning simpler and more transparent. We're travelers who got tired of sifting through endless booking sites, comparing prices across dozens of tabs, and wondering whether we were actually getting good deals. So we built something better.</p>
                    
                    <p>Our platform brings together flight searches, car rentals, and airport transfers in one place, with straightforward comparisons and honest guidance. We don't hide fees, push unnecessary upgrades, or use dark patterns to manipulate your decisions. We show you options, explain what they mean, and let you choose what works best for your trip.</p>
                </section>

                <section class="content-section">
                    <h2>What We Do</h2>
                    <p>Ryokome helps you find and book the travel services you need:</p>
                    
                    <h3>Flight Comparison</h3>
                    <p>We search hundreds of airlines and booking platforms to show you available flights and their prices. Our search tools pull real-time data so you see current availability and fares. We provide context about flight options—not just prices, but information about airlines, connection times, and booking flexibility.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Car Rental Guidance</h3>
                    <p>Renting a car isn't always the right choice, and we tell you that honestly. Our car rental content helps you understand when rentals make sense, how to compare options, and what to watch out for. When you decide a rental works for your trip, we connect you with comparison tools to find the best rates.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Airport Transfer Information</h3>
                    <p>Getting from the airport to your destination is often the most stressful part of arrival. We explain different transport options, help you understand when pre-booked transfers are worth it, and provide practical advice for navigating airport transportation in unfamiliar places.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Practical Travel Resources</h3>
                    <p>Beyond booking tools, we create genuinely helpful travel content. Our travel checklist isn't copied from other sites—it's refined through real travel experience and organized logically. Our guides aim to answer the questions you actually have, not just push affiliate products.</p>

                <section class="content-section">
                    <h2>How We Make Money</h2>
                    <p>Transparency is important, so let's be direct: Ryokome earns affiliate commissions when you book through our search tools and widgets. If you find a flight, car rental, or transfer through our site and complete a booking, we may receive a small commission from the booking platform.</p>
                    
                    <p>This doesn't affect your price—you pay the same amount whether you book through us or go directly to the booking site. The commission comes from the booking platform as a referral fee for connecting you to their service.</p>
                    
                    <p>Our affiliate relationships don't change our recommendations or content. We don't promote certain options because they pay higher commissions. We focus on providing accurate, helpful information that serves your needs first. If something isn't a good choice for your situation, we say so, even if we could earn more by pushing you toward it.</p>
                    
                    <p>For full details about our affiliate relationships and how they work, see our <a href="affiliate-disclosure.html">Affiliate Disclosure</a>.</p>

                    <h2>Our Approach to Content</h2>
                    <p>The travel industry is full of thin content designed purely to capture search traffic and push bookings. We're trying to do something different. Our content aims to actually help you make better decisions, not just sell you things.</p>
                    
                    <p>When we write about finding cheap flights, we give you strategies that work based on how flight pricing actually functions. When we discuss car rentals, we honestly explain when you don't need one. Our travel checklist includes items we genuinely use and explain why they matter.</p>
                    
                    <p>We won't always be perfect, and we're continuously improving our content based on feedback and new information. But our commitment is to honest, helpful guidance that respects your time and intelligence.</p>

                    <h2>Privacy and Data</h2>
                    <p>We take your privacy seriously. Ryokome doesn't sell your personal information. We use standard analytics to understand how people use our site and make improvements, but we don't build detailed profiles or track you across the internet.</p>
                    
                    <p>When you use our booking widgets, you're interacting with third-party services that have their own privacy policies. We've chosen partners we believe handle data responsibly, but you should review their policies when booking.</p>
                    
                    <p>For complete details about how we handle data and what information we collect, see our <a href="privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

                    <h2>Contact and Feedback</h2>
                    <p>We want to hear from you. If you have questions, find errors in our content, or have suggestions for improving Ryokome, please reach out. Travel is constantly changing—prices fluctuate, policies evolve, and new options emerge. Your feedback helps us stay accurate and relevant.</p>
                    
                    <p>We're not a huge operation, so response times might vary, but we read and consider all feedback. Whether you've found something helpful or want to tell us where we're missing the mark, we appreciate you taking the time to connect.</p>

                    <h2>Looking Forward</h2>
                    <p>Ryokome is evolving. We're continuously working to improve our content, add new resources, and refine our booking tools. Our goal is building something that travelers genuinely find valuable—not just a collection of search widgets and thin SEO content.</p>
                    
                    <p>Travel planning should be exciting, not exhausting. We're here to handle the tedious research and comparison work so you can focus on the fun parts: choosing destinations, planning activities, and actually experiencing new places.</p>
                    
                    <p>Thank you for using Ryokome. We hope we help make your next trip a little easier to plan and a lot more enjoyable to experience.</p>
