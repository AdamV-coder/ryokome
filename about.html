        <h1>About Ryokome</h1>

        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>Ryokome was founded with a simple but powerful mission: to make travel accessible and affordable for everyone. We believe that exploring the world shouldn't require endless hours of research across dozens of websites or worrying about whether you're getting the best deal. Our platform brings together pricing from hundreds of airlines, hotels, and car rental companies, empowering travelers to make informed decisions and save money on every trip.</p>

        <h2>What We Do</h2>
        <p>Ryokome is a comprehensive travel comparison platform that searches and compares prices across the travel industry. When you use Ryokome, you're simultaneously searching hundreds of booking sites, airlines, and travel agencies. Our technology aggregates this information and presents it in an easy-to-understand format, showing you all available options so you can choose the best flight, hotel, or rental car for your specific needs and budget.</p>

        <p>We specialize in several key areas of travel booking:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Flight Comparison:</strong> Search across major airlines, budget carriers, and online travel agencies to find the cheapest flights and best routes for any destination worldwide.</li>
          <li><strong>Car Rentals:</strong> Compare prices from global and local car rental companies to secure reliable vehicles at competitive rates.</li>
          <li><strong>Airport Transfers:</strong> Find convenient ground transportation options including shared shuttles, private transfers, and luxury services.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How We Work</h2>
        <p>Ryokome operates as a search and comparison platform. We don't sell flights, hotels, or car rentals directly. Instead, when you search on Ryokome, our technology queries hundreds of travel websites in real-time, gathering current prices and availability. We organize these results to help you identify the best options based on price, convenience, and value.</p>

        <p>When you find an option you like, we direct you to the airline or booking site where you complete your purchase. This ensures you're booking with established, reputable providers while benefiting from Ryokome's comprehensive search capabilities. We earn a small commission from our partner sites when you make a booking, which allows us to keep our service completely free for travelers.</p>

        <h2>Our Commitment to Transparency</h2>
        <p>We're committed to providing honest, unbiased travel comparison services. Our search results are ranked primarily by price and value, not by commission rates. We clearly disclose our affiliate relationships and how we earn revenue. You'll never pay more by using Ryokome – the prices you see on our site match what you'd pay by booking directly with the airline or travel provider.</p>

        <p>We believe transparency builds trust. That's why we provide detailed information about what's included in each price, airline policies, and booking terms. We want you to make informed decisions with complete confidence, knowing exactly what you're getting before you book.</p>

        <h2>Who We Serve</h2>
        <p>Ryokome serves millions of travelers worldwide, from budget backpackers to business executives, families planning vacations to solo adventurers seeking spontaneous getaways. Our platform works for anyone who wants to save time and money on travel bookings. Whether you're booking a last-minute domestic flight or planning an international trip months in advance, Ryokome helps you find the best available options.</p>

        <h2>Why Choose Ryokome</h2>
        <p>The travel booking landscape can be overwhelming with countless websites offering different prices, each with unique features and search interfaces. Ryokome simplifies this complexity by bringing everything together in one place. Instead of opening multiple tabs and comparing prices manually, you get comprehensive results from a single search.</p>

        <p>Our platform offers several key advantages:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Time Savings:</strong> Search hundreds of sites simultaneously instead of visiting them individually.</li>
          <li><strong>Best Prices:</strong> Compare all available options to ensure you're getting competitive rates.</li>
          <li><strong>No Hidden Fees:</strong> See transparent pricing with all costs displayed upfront.</li>
          <li><strong>User-Friendly:</strong> Intuitive search tools and filters help you find exactly what you need quickly.</li>
          <li><strong>Comprehensive Coverage:</strong> Access to global airlines, booking sites, and travel providers.</li>
          <li><strong>Always Free:</strong> No subscription fees or charges for using our comparison tools.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Our Technology</h2>
        <p>Behind Ryokome's simple interface is sophisticated search technology that queries hundreds of travel websites, processes millions of data points, and delivers results in seconds. Our systems constantly update prices and availability to ensure you're seeing current, accurate information. We invest heavily in technology infrastructure to provide fast, reliable service even during peak travel booking periods.</p>

        <h2>Looking Forward</h2>
        <p>Travel continues to evolve, and so does Ryokome. We're constantly improving our platform based on user feedback and emerging travel trends. Our goal is to expand our coverage, enhance our search capabilities, and provide even more value to travelers worldwide. We're committed to remaining at the forefront of travel comparison technology while maintaining the simplicity and transparency that our users appreciate.</p>

        <h2>Contact & Support</h2>
