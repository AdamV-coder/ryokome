        <p>Cookies serve various purposes, such as remembering your preferences, analyzing how you use the website, and enabling certain features. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can modify your browser settings to decline cookies if you prefer.</p>

      <section class="content-section">
        <h2>How We Use Cookies</h2>
        <p>Ryokome uses cookies and similar tracking technologies to enhance your browsing experience, analyze website performance, and understand how visitors interact with our site. These technologies help us improve our services and provide relevant information to users.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="content-section">
        <h2>Types of Cookies We Use</h2>

        <h3>Essential Cookies</h3>
        <p>These cookies are necessary for the website to function properly. They enable core functionality such as navigation, security features, and access to certain areas of the website. The website cannot function properly without these cookies, and they are set automatically when you visit.</p>

        <p>Examples include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Session management cookies</li>
          <li>Security cookies to prevent fraudulent activity</li>
          <li>Load balancing cookies to ensure stable website performance</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Analytics and Performance Cookies</h3>
        <p>These cookies collect information about how visitors use our website, such as which pages are visited most often, how long users stay on pages, and whether they encounter error messages. This information is aggregated and anonymous.</p>

        <h3>Affiliate and Tracking Cookies</h3>
        <p>As explained in our <a href="/affiliate-disclosure.html">Affiliate Disclosure</a>, we participate in affiliate marketing programs.

          <li>Expire after a set period (typically 30-90 days)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Third-Party Cookies</h3>
        <p>When you use search widgets and tools on our website provided by affiliate partners, those third parties may set their own cookies. These cookies are governed by the privacy policies of the respective third parties.</p>

        <p>Third-party cookies may be set by:</p>
        <ul>

      <section class="content-section">
        <h2>Cookie Duration</h2>

        <h3>Persistent Cookies</h3>
        <p>Persistent cookies remain on your device for a set period specified in the cookie or until you manually delete them. They are used to remember your preferences and recognize you when you return to our website.</p>

        <h2>Managing Cookie Preferences</h2>

        <h3>Browser Settings</h3>

          <li>Delete cookies when you close your browser</li>

        </ul>

        <p>Please note that blocking or deleting cookies may impact your ability to use certain features of our website and may affect your browsing experience.</p>

      <section class="content-section">
        <h2>Other Tracking Technologies</h2>

        <h3>Web Beacons and Pixels</h3>
        <p>In addition to cookies, we may use web beacons (also known as tracking pixels or clear GIFs). These are tiny graphics embedded in web pages or emails that track whether content has been viewed or an action has been taken.</p>

        <p>Web beacons are used to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Measure website traffic and user behavior</li>
          <li>Track the effectiveness of marketing campaigns</li>
          <li>Understand email engagement (if we send communications)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Local Storage</h3>
        <p>We may use local storage technologies (such as HTML5 local storage) to store information on your device. Local storage is similar to cookies but can store larger amounts of data and is not automatically transmitted to the server with every request.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="content-section">
        <h2>Do Not Track Signals</h2>
        <p>Some browsers offer a Do Not Track (DNT) signal that sends a message to websites requesting that your browsing not be tracked. Currently, there is no industry consensus on how to respond to DNT signals, and our website does not respond to or alter its behavior based on DNT settings in your browser.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="content-section">
        <h2>Impact of Declining Cookies</h2>
