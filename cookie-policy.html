        <h1>Cookie Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> January 2024</p>

        <h2>What Are Cookies</h2>
        <p>Cookies are small text files that are placed on your device (computer, smartphone, or tablet) when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used to make websites work more efficiently and provide information to website owners. They help websites remember your actions and preferences over time, so you don't have to re-enter information when you return to a site or browse from one page to another.</p>

        <h2>How We Use Cookies</h2>
        <p>Ryokome uses cookies and similar tracking technologies to improve your experience on our website, understand how you use our services, and deliver relevant content and advertisements. We use both first-party cookies (set by Ryokome) and third-party cookies (set by our partners and service providers).</p>

        <h2>Types of Cookies We Use</h2>

        <h3>Essential Cookies</h3>
        <p>These cookies are necessary for our website to function properly. They enable core functionality such as security, network management, and accessibility. Without these cookies, our services cannot be provided effectively. Essential cookies do not require your consent as they are necessary for the website to work.</p>
        <p><strong>Examples:</strong> Session management, load balancing, security authentication</p>

        <h3>Analytical/Performance Cookies</h3>
        <p>These cookies help us understand how visitors interact with our website by collecting and reporting information anonymously. We use this data to improve our website's functionality and user experience. These cookies track metrics such as number of visitors, pages visited, time spent on pages, and navigation patterns.</p>
        <p><strong>Examples:</strong> Google Analytics, internal analytics tools</p>

        <h3>Functionality Cookies</h3>
        <p>These cookies enable our website to remember choices you make (such as your preferred language or region) and provide enhanced, more personalized features. They may be set by us or by third-party providers whose services we have added to our pages.</p>
        <p><strong>Examples:</strong> Language preferences, currency selection, previous searches</p>

        <h3>Targeting/Advertising Cookies</h3>
        <p>These cookies are used to deliver advertisements that are more relevant to you and your interests. They are also used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement and help measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns. These cookies may be set by us or by our advertising partners and may be used to build a profile of your interests across different websites.</p>
        <p><strong>Examples:</strong> Google Ads, Facebook Pixel, retargeting platforms</p>

        <h3>Social Media Cookies</h3>
        <p>These cookies are set by social media platforms and enable you to share content from our website on social networks. Social media companies may also use these cookies to track your browsing activity across different websites and build a profile of your interests.</p>
        <p><strong>Examples:</strong> Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn sharing buttons</p>

        <h2>Third-Party Cookies</h2>
        <p>Some of our pages display content from external providers (such as flight search widgets, hotel booking tools, or embedded videos). To view this third-party content, you may need to accept their cookies. We do not control the cookies set by these external providers. Please check their websites for more information about the cookies they use and how to manage them.</p>

        </ul>

        <h2>How Long Do Cookies Last</h2>

        <h3>Session Cookies</h3>
        <p>These temporary cookies expire when you close your browser. They are used primarily for security and to maintain your session as you navigate between pages.</p>

        <h3>Persistent Cookies</h3>
        <p>These cookies remain on your device for a set period or until you delete them. The duration varies depending on the cookie's purpose. Most analytical cookies last 2 years, while advertising cookies may last 30-90 days. Functional cookies typically last 1 year.</p>

        <h2>Managing Your Cookie Preferences</h2>

        <h3>Browser Settings</h3>
        <p>Most web browsers allow you to manage cookies through their settings. You can set your browser to refuse all cookies or to alert you when a cookie is being sent. However, if you disable or refuse cookies, some features of our website may not function properly or at all.</p>

        <p>Here's how to manage cookies in common browsers:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Google Chrome:</strong> Settings > Privacy and Security > Cookies and other site data</li>
          <li><strong>Mozilla Firefox:</strong> Options > Privacy & Security > Cookies and Site Data</li>
          <li><strong>Safari:</strong> Preferences > Privacy > Cookies and website data</li>
          <li><strong>Microsoft Edge:</strong> Settings > Cookies and site permissions > Cookies and site data</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Opt-Out Tools</h3>
        <p>You can opt out of targeted advertising cookies through various industry opt-out tools:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Digital Advertising Alliance: <a href="https://optout.aboutads.info" target="_blank" rel="noopener">optout.aboutads.info</a></li>
          <li>Network Advertising Initiative: <a href="https://optout.networkadvertising.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">optout.networkadvertising.org</a></li>
          <li>Your Online Choices (EU): <a href="https://www.youronlinechoices.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">youronlinechoices.com</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Mobile Device Settings</h3>
        <p>Mobile devices also offer settings to control tracking:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>iOS:</strong> Settings > Privacy > Advertising > Limit Ad Tracking</li>
          <li><strong>Android:</strong> Settings > Google > Ads > Opt out of Ads Personalization</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Do Not Track Signals</h2>
        <p>Some browsers include a "Do Not Track" (DNT) feature that signals to websites that you do not want to be tracked. Currently, there is no industry standard for how websites should respond to DNT signals. Ryokome does not currently respond to DNT signals, but you can use the cookie management options described above to control tracking.</p>

        <h2>Web Beacons and Pixel Tags</h2>
        <p>In addition to cookies, we may use web beacons (also known as pixel tags or clear GIFs) on our website and in emails. These are small graphic images that allow us to monitor user activity and track email effectiveness. Web beacons work in conjunction with cookies to collect information about your usage patterns.</p>

        <h2>Updates to This Cookie Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Cookie Policy from time to time to reflect changes in technology, legislation, or our business practices. We will post any changes on this page with an updated "Last Updated" date. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.</p>

        <h2>More Information</h2>
