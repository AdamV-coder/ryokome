                    <h2>What Are Cookies?</h2>
                    <p>Cookies are small text files that are placed on your device (computer, smartphone, tablet) when you visit a website. They are widely used to make websites work more efficiently and provide information to website owners.</p>
                    
                    <p>Cookies allow websites to recognize your device and remember information about your visit, such as your preferences and past activity. This improves your browsing experience and helps website owners understand how their sites are being used.</p>
                </section>

                <section class="content-section">
                    <h2>Types of Cookies We Use</h2>
                    
                    <h3>Essential Cookies</h3>
                    <p>These cookies are necessary for the website to function properly. They enable core functionality such as security, navigation, and accessibility features. Without these cookies, some parts of the Site may not work correctly.</p>
                    
                    <p>Examples include cookies that remember your consent choices and cookies used by our hosting provider to ensure Site security.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Analytics Cookies</h3>
                    <p>These cookies help us understand how visitors use our Site by collecting information about which pages are visited, how long visitors stay, and what links they click. This information is aggregated and anonymous—we cannot identify individual users from this data.</p>
                    
                    <p>We use analytics cookies to improve our Site's content, navigation, and user experience. Examples include Google Analytics cookies that track page views and user sessions.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Affiliate and Marketing Cookies</h3>
                    <p>These cookies are used to track referrals to our affiliate partners' booking platforms. When you click on a booking widget or search tool and complete a transaction, these cookies help attribute the sale to our Site so we can receive an affiliate commission.</p>
                    
                    <p>Our affiliate partners (including TravelPayouts and Aviasales) place their own cookies when you interact with their widgets. These third-party cookies are governed by the respective partner's cookie policy and privacy policy.</p>

                    <h3>Affiliate Partner Cookies</h3>
                    <p>Our booking widgets are provided by third-party affiliate partners. These partners use cookies to provide search functionality, track bookings, and attribute sales. These cookies are subject to the third party's own policies.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Analytics Provider Cookies</h3>
                    <p>We may use third-party analytics services like Google Analytics. These services use cookies to collect information about Site usage. The analytics providers have their own privacy and cookie policies.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Hosting Provider Cookies</h3>
                    <p>Our hosting provider, Cloudflare, may use cookies for security, performance optimization, and analytics purposes. Cloudflare's use of cookies is governed by their privacy and cookie policies.</p>

                    <h3>Persistent Cookies</h3>
                    <p>These cookies remain on your device for a set period or until you delete them. They remember your preferences and actions across multiple visits. Analytics and affiliate cookies are typically persistent, lasting from a few days to several years depending on their purpose.</p>

                    <h3>Browser Controls</h3>
                    <p>Most web browsers allow you to control cookies through settings. You can typically:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>View what cookies are stored on your device</li>
                        <li>Delete some or all cookies</li>
                        <li>Block all cookies from being set</li>
                        <li>Block third-party cookies specifically</li>
                        <li>Clear cookies when you close your browser</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>Browser help pages provide instructions for managing cookies in specific browsers:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Google Chrome</li>
                        <li>Mozilla Firefox</li>

                    <h3>Effect of Blocking Cookies</h3>
                    <p>Please note that blocking or deleting cookies may affect your experience on our Site. Some features may not work properly if you refuse cookies. Specifically:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Essential cookies are required for basic Site functionality</li>
                        <li>Blocking analytics cookies won't affect your experience but prevents us from understanding how the Site is used</li>
                        <li>Blocking affiliate cookies may affect our ability to earn commissions but won't prevent you from accessing booking tools</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3>Mobile Device Settings</h3>
                    <p>Mobile devices have settings that allow you to control tracking and cookies. Check your device's privacy settings for options to limit ad tracking and cookie use.</p>

                <section class="content-section">
                    <h2>Do Not Track Signals</h2>
                    <p>Some browsers support "Do Not Track" (DNT) signals, which request that websites not track your browsing activity. Currently, there is no universal standard for how websites should respond to DNT signals.</p>
                    
                    <p>Our Site does not currently respond to Do Not Track signals. However, you can still control cookies through your browser settings as described above.</p>

                    <h2>Other Tracking Technologies</h2>
                    <p>In addition to cookies, we may use other tracking technologies including:</p>
                    
                    <h3>Web Beacons</h3>
                    <p>Also known as pixel tags or clear GIFs, these are small graphic images embedded in web pages or emails. They work with cookies to track user activity and gather information about Site usage.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Local Storage</h3>
                    <p>Some modern websites use local storage technology to store data on your device. This functions similarly to cookies but can store more data and persists even after you close your browser unless manually deleted.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Scripts</h3>
                    <p>JavaScript and other scripts collect information about how you interact with the Site, such as mouse movements, clicks, and form interactions. This helps us understand user behavior and improve Site usability.</p>
